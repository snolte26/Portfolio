	<h2>Background</h2>
	<h3>General Bio</h3>
	<p>I was born in Kansas to an American Father and Russian mother. I am technically a second generation Russian from my mother. A few years after being born, we moved out to Indiana for my fathers work, where I would inevitablly grow up. </p>
	<h3>Schooling</h3>
	<p>There isn't much that is interesting about my schooling until high school. High school was where my interests for my career started to develop. Besides the usual classes that everyone has to take, I mostly took engineering and computer science classes. I also developed, and still have, an interest for psychology, though it wasn't something I wanted to make a career out of. </p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>Extra Curricular</h2>
	
	<h3>Boy Scouts of America</h3>
	<p>I have been a member of the Boy Scouts of Amaerica since early 2011. During 2015/16 I took on the roll of being the Senior Patrol Leader. Within BSA, I have been a part of the Order of the Arrow as well as FireCrafter. In November of 2017, I was awarded the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest rank achievable in scouting.</p>
	
	<h3>Karate</h3>
	<p>I have been attending a local karate academy since I was 6 years old. Throughout the years, not only did I grow in self defense skills, but also had personal development and pushed me to try more and be more outgoing. In 2013 I had become a black belt, and since then I have been learning more and growing my skills in self defense. Occasionally I will substitute for the owner/head teacher and teach younger students what I have been taught.</p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<h3>Dungeons and Dragons</h3>
	<p>Back in 2018, I had started developing an interest for Dungeons and Dragons (dnd). Finding people and time to be able to play dnd was hard at first, and still is. First learning to play was also a struggle, but now having a few years of experience I better understand the mechanics and rules to a point where I can effectively teach newer players. I have also used Python to create different scripts to help with basic mechanics.</p>
	<h3>Programming</h3>
	<p>From time to time, I will come up with different ideas for programs to make. I typically deal with Python, however i do have some experience in Java and JavaScript. As for why I primarily like to use Python, I like to quote YouTuber Michael Reeves, "...Python can do anything, just badly."</p>
